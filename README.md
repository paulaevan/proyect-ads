## This collaborative project aims to develop a comprehensive web platform and API for providing detailed information about various cryptocurrencies. Hosted on PythonAnywhere, the platform will leverage a NoSQL database to accommodate the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. Through extensive research and development, the project will offer users a user-friendly interface to browse, search, and filter cryptocurrency data. Additionally, an API will be provided to allow seamless integration with other applications.

## -We created the flask app wich allows users to search for and retrieve detailed information about various cryptocurrencies. It utilizes Flask for web framework, TinyDB for database management, and pandas for data manipulation. The main feutures of the app are Search Functionality: Users can search for cryptocurrencies by symbol or name. Database Integration: Utilizes TinyDB to store and query cryptocurrency information. User-friendly Interface: The application provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to interact with.

## -Then we created the HMLT that connects the falsk app to the web, our HTML code creates a visually appealing and functional web page for searching and displaying cryptocurrency information. It leverages CSS for styling and Flask's templating engine for dynamic content rendering.

## -The dataset was converted into a format that TinyDB can work with, which is JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). By doing so, the team can manage any missing data within the dataset without explicitly marking them as 'N/A'. TinyDB allows for more flexible handling of data, including missing values, which can be beneficial for database management and querying purposes.
